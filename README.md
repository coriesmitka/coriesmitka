# üëã Hi, I'm Corie Smitka

I'm a dynamic and resilient software engineer, data analyst, and woman in STEM with over 20 years of experience building secure, scalable, enterprise-grade systems. My passion lies in making data come alive ‚Äî not just through dashboards, but through purpose-driven analytics that tell deeper stories.

After navigating a personal journey of stroke recovery, I've reignited my career by combining my expertise in systems engineering with cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, Power BI, and cloud platforms. My work reflects not only technical depth, but a mission-driven mindset to create meaningful, inclusive, and intelligent solutions.

## üåç About Me

As a woman in STEM and lifelong builder of systems, I bring a mission-focused mindset to everything I do ‚Äî from backend architecture to data equity. I‚Äôm especially passionate about closing the gender data gap in spaces where representation has long been overlooked.

After two decades of designing secure, enterprise-grade software, I‚Äôve transitioned into data-focused work that fuses analytics, visualization, and machine learning with real-world impact. My projects now explore how biased datasets shape outcomes ‚Äî and how better insights can empower more inclusive decisions in sports, tech, and beyond.

Whether I‚Äôm building real-time ETL pipelines, training ML models, or turning raw data into decision-ready dashboards, I lead with curiosity, clarity, and purpose.
