# üòÑ Hi, I'm Corie Smitka


I‚Äôm a dynamic and resilient software engineer, data analyst, and woman in STEM with over 20 years of experience building secure, scalable, enterprise-grade systems. My passion lies in making data come alive ‚Äî not just through dashboards, but through purpose-driven analytics that reveal deeper patterns, context, and insight.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve thrived at the intersection of software integration, system architecture, and data transformation ‚Äî bringing together legacy technologies, modern cloud stacks, and evolving delivery frameworks. My background in engineering has given me the privilege of deeply understanding the ‚Äúhow‚Äù behind the systems ‚Äî and now, I‚Äôm applying that to the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù through meaningful, analytics-driven solutions.

After navigating a personal journey of stroke recovery, I‚Äôve reignited my career by combining that core engineering foundation with machine learning, Power BI, and cloud platforms. I continue to evolve ‚Äî driven not only by technical curiosity, but by a mission to build inclusive, intelligent, and real-world impact systems.

### üåç About Me and My Tech Journey

<details>
  <summary><strong> Expand to read full story</strong></summary>

  <br/>
I‚Äôve spent the last 20 years riding the pulse of technology ‚Äî growing alongside it, adapting through every shift, and leading through each transformation.

My early career was rooted in on-prem systems and monolithic applications, where I worked on large-scale enterprise solutions using C/C++, Java, and SQL. These projects were delivered in high-stakes, waterfall environments ‚Äî often multi-year initiatives where I led complex planning, stakeholder alignment, and delivery assurance across tightly coupled systems.

As the tech world shifted toward integration, cloud, and agility, so did I. I moved from traditional release models into SAFe Agile, embracing iterative delivery, feature-driven roadmaps, and CI/CD pipelines to deliver faster, smarter, and with reduced risk. My hands-on development evolved into leadership roles ‚Äî guiding teams through DevOps adoption, cloud-native architectures, and enterprise-level transformation programs.

From legacy to cloud, from project plans to pipelines, my journey reflects a dual mastery: technology execution and delivery excellence.

Today, I focus on the frontier of data, machine learning, and AI ‚Äî designing solutions that are not only intelligent, but strategic.

I don‚Äôt just work with technology ‚Äî I grow with it.
And I bring that evolution to every team I join.
