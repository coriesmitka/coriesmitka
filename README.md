# 👋 Hi, I'm Corie Smitka

I'm a dynamic and resilient software engineer, data analyst, and woman in STEM with over 20 years of experience building secure, scalable, enterprise-grade systems. My passion lies in making data come alive — not just through dashboards, but through purpose-driven analytics that tell deeper stories.

After navigating a personal journey of stroke recovery, I've reignited my career by combining my expertise in systems engineering with cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, Power BI, and cloud platforms. My work reflects not only technical depth, but a mission-driven mindset to create meaningful, inclusive, and intelligent solutions.

## 🔭 Current Projects

### 🔥 [Flames Player Development Analysis](https://github.com/coriesmitka/flames-player-development-template) *(Private – Structure Preview Only)*

A structured, end-to-end project built around NHL and PWHL player development pipelines:

- NHL API integration (roster, player, game logs)
- Power BI dashboards for performance tracking
- ML-based growth modeling for player comparison
- PWHL Gender equity analysis inspired by *Invisible Women*
- SQL-based performance views and filtered pipelines for Power BI
- GitHub integration with templated public/private structure

This project merges my technical background with my passion for sports analytics and gender inclusion in STEM — using data to identify growth trends, disparities, and opportunities across men’s and women’s hockey.

## 🌍 About Me

As a woman in STEM, I’m driven to close the gender data gap by using the tools of engineering, machine learning, and data science to elevate voices often left out of traditional analysis. My technical roots span enterprise systems, secure cloud infrastructure, and high-stakes DevOps — but today, I’m applying those skills to build inclusive, ethical, and insightful data solutions.

Whether developing real-time ETL pipelines, designing ML models, or visualizing growth trends, I bring persistence, precision, and purpose to every project I touch.
